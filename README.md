# fsharp_project_template
This is a generic setup for an F# console project using 
[.Net 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0), with [Expecto](https://github.com/haf/expecto) for testing,  
and [Argu](http://fsprojects.github.io/Argu/) for command line argument parsing.   

Take it with a grain of salt. The author is new to the .Net platform, this is an attempt 
to work out how some of the pieces work together, in a setting with minimal clutter. Blind leading the blind 
and all that.
